denoJS Rest API Example

This is merely meant to be an example of a Rest API, primarily for me to get some exposure to deno. The first run through will be in vanilla javascript (though using ```.ts``` files) with the end goal being to work on it iterativly until it is fully migrated to TypeScript. If you want to follow along feel free to fork this repository.

### Getting up and running

1. install deno
[deno.land](https://deno.land/) has their prefered installation method depending on the operating system you are using.

2. run
```bash
deno run --allow-net server.ts
```
